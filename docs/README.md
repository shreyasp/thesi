# thesi

_This plugin was created using `skpm`. For a detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [skpm Readme](https://github.com/skpm/skpm/blob/master/README.md)._

## CLI Commands

``` bash
# build with hot reload
npm run watch

# build for production
npm run build
```

## Custom Configuration

Skpm provides a convenient way to do the latter:

```bash
skpm log
```

The `-f` option causes `skpm log` to not stop when the end of logs is reached, but rather to wait for additional data to be appended to the input
